The precision for the positive class (class 1) is 42.24%, which, while not ideal, indicates that when the model does identify a positive case, there is a reasonable likelihood of success. Additionally, the model's predicted stock average return of 1.05902 slightly outperforms the S&P 500 return of 1.05889, showing that the model has potential in generating competitive returns.\n",

By refining these areas, the model could become a more reliable tool for developing an effective investment strategy."
